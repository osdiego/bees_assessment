# bees_assessment

Private repository that contains the code for the Streetbees Data Engineer - technical assessment.

## Information regarding the repository

Looking at the folder structure, you will be able to see 3 folders, one for each task.
The instructions to assess each of the tasks are on the README.md of the respective folders.

## Instructions to be able to run the code

- Install python (Python 3.9.7 was the one used for development, so any version higher than that should work without problems)
- Install the necessary dependencies using a packaging tool of your choice, running one of the following with pip will do the job:
  - pip install --upgrade -r [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
  - python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt (in case the pip can't be found due to PATH not well configured)
- You should now be able to run the scripts
