# Task 2 â€“ Create a package

## Short description of the task

In this task is requested to create a package with the functions that were built in the Task 1.

## Instructions to run the code

TODO

## Deliverables

- Zip file with the code of the package
- Documentation
- Wheel of the package (not required, but nice to have)
- Make the package available on PyPi (not required, and asked explicitly on the docx to not make any repos public, so it won't be done)

## Planed actions

- Make a package with the functions of the Task 1, but generalize them
- Add unit tests (pytest) - 100% coverage is not required, but ideal
- Add documentation (to be defined how)
- Create a wheel of the code
- Zip the code
